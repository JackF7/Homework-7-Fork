2). PHP and JavaScript are both interpreted scripting/programming languages that undergo interpretation. Each plays a crucial role in web development and can be integrated into HTML code. While PHP is used in server-side scripting, JavaScript is designed for client-side functionality. 
Another distinction lies in JavaScript's support for asynchronous programming, a feature not present in PHP.
PHP is frequently employed alongside server-side development environments, such as Apache or Nginx. In contrast, JavaScript is primarily associated with web browsers but can extend its functionality to server-side execution through technologies like Node.js.

3). MVC serves as an architectural or design pattern that separates an application into three primary logical components: model, view, and controller. 
Each component is crafted to manage specific developmental aspects, ensuring a clear separation between business logic and the presentation layer.
The Model component encompasses all data-related logic that users interact with, managing data transfers between the View and Controller or other business logic-related data. 
It can perform tasks such as adding or retrieving data from a database and responding to controller requests.
The View component is dedicated to the UI logic of the application, responsible for generating the user interface. The View exclusively interacts with the controller.
The Controller serves as the intermediary, facilitating communication between the views and the model. Its role is to instruct the model. It processes incoming requests, manages all business logic,
manipulates data through the Model component, and engages with the View to produce the final output.
